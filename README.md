This is a project marketplace app for buying and selling projects (college main projects, mini projects, personal projects, etc.). Users can post their project details and others can purchase these projects through the app. Sellers can set their own price for each project, and the app adds a 200-rupee service charge to the listed price. For example, if a seller prices their project at 1000 rupees, the total cost would be 1200 rupees. The app also offers developer supportâ€”if buyers need help understanding or working with their purchased project, they can request support from a developer. These developers can schedule meetings to help solve issues and receive payment through the app. Developers can earn up to 400 rupees for a 30-minute support session...
